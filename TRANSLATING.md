# Translating Gradia

Thank you for your interest in translating Gradia! This guide will help you contribute translations to make Gradia accessible to more users around the world.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Gradia repository** and clone it to your local machine.

2. Locate the translation template file, found at `po/gradia.pot`.

3. Open the `gradia.pot` file in [Poedit](https://poedit.net/).

4. In Poedit, create a new translation by selecting your target language. Poedit will generate a new `.po` file for that language.

5. Save the new `.po` file in the `po/` directory, following the naming convention for your language code, e.g., `fr.po`, `de.po`, or `nl.po`.

6. Add your language code to the `po/LINGUAS` file to register your translation.

## Translating

* Use Poedit's interface to translate each message carefully, some entries will have notes/comments attached to them.
* Poedit may sometimes generate a `.mo` file, but this file is not needed because it is already generated when building the app.


## Submitting Your Translation

1. Commit your `.po` file and the updated `po/LINGUAS` file.
2. Push the changes to your fork.
3. Open a Pull Request against the main Gradia repository with a title beginning with `i18n:`.
